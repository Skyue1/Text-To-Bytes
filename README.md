# Text-To-Bytes
This C++ program reads a binary file, searches for a specified text pattern, and prints the positions where the text is found along with the corresponding hexadecimal values at those positions. The user provides the file path and the text to be searched. If the text is found, it displays the results and waits for user input before exiting.
